# HexSpace

An exploration of game construction with hexkit and ggez.

```rust
cargo run --release
```

The following are some of the aspects explored in this code:

  * Constructing scollable, framed UIs with hexkit and ggez.
  * Creating a responsive UI for turn-based hexagonal games, including
    animations, while minimising CPU use of the main game loop.
  * Exploring path-finding on hexagonal maps.
  * Separation of the core game state machine from the UI, e.g. for ease of
    testing.
