# HexSpace

An exploration of game construction with `hexggez`.

```rust
cargo run --release
```

The following are some of the aspects explored in this code:

  * Constructing scollable, framed UIs.
  * Creating a responsive UI for turn-based hex map games, including
    animations, while minimising CPU use of the main game loop.
  * Exploring path-finding on hex maps.
  * Exploring separation of a core game state machine from the UI,
    e.g. for ease of testing.
